# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton existing in two-dimensional space where each cell possesses one of two states, alive or dead. Each cell will interact with its neighbors and will either evolve to the next state or remain the same following a set of rules.

## Installing Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Program
`python3 main.py`

## How It Works
Click on a cell to set its initial seed state to `alive`. From there, hit the `space` key to start the process in which the grid will perform its evolution overtime.
